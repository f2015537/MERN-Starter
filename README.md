### MERN_Starter Pack Loaded with CRUD Operations(tested with POSTMAN)
 Ready to use starter pack for full stack MERN Apps.
 1) Clone repo
 2) Navigate to cloned repo.
 3) Run `npm install` to install backend dependencies.
 4) Run `npm run client-install` to install frontend(react) dependencies.
 5) Run `npm run dev` to run concurrently.
 6) Run `sudo npm i -g nodemon` to install nodemon globally.
 7) Run `npm run server` to run backend with nodemon.
 8) Run `npm start` to run backend with node.
 9) Run `npm run client` to run frontend(react).
 10) Run `rm -rf .git` and then run `git init` to start adding your own changes. (And get rid of my muddy commit history lol :P)

### Possible Improvements
Adding redux boilerplate
